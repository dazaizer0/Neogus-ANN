# NeogusAI
- next step: Implementation of NeogusAI multi-application functionality
  
# About 
- ANN Artificial Neural Network is an amateur project whose goal is to create a universal library with functions and classes working on teaching neurons to solve problems. For example, distinguishing a ring from a pen, a square from a rectangle, and even in the later stages of analyzing and learning handwriting. The ANN Project uses the following libraries: numpy and bottle, and in AI there will be programs at a higher level of machine learning written using the Flask and TensorFlow libraries
